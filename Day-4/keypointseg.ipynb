    "In this tutorial, we will learn a network that segments approximate location of three facial landmarks on human faces: the eyes and mouth.\n",

    "-|-\n",
    "![image](img1.jpg) | ![image](lbl1.jpg)\n",
    "![image](img2.jpg) | ![image](lbl2.jpg)\n",

    "The output tensor has the shape $H\\times W\\times 3$ for an input image of $H\\times W$ pixels.\n",
    "Each channel is used as a heat map for a different facial landmark.\n",
    "If a facial landmark is on a coordinate $(x^*, y^*)$, then the heat map has the following form:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    M(x, y)=\n",
    "    \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x^* - x)^2 + (y^* - y)^2}{2\\cdot s\\cdot\\sigma}\\right)\n",

    "\n",
    "The L2 [hinge loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinge_loss) is defined as follows for the value $\\delta\\in\\mathbb{R}$:\n",
