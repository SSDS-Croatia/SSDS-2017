    "In this exercise we will train an end-to-end convolutional neural network for semantic segmentation.\n",
    "The goal of semantic segmentation is to classify the image on the pixel level. For each pixel\n",
    "we want to determine the class of the object to which it belongs. This is different from image classification\n",
    "which classifies an image as a whole and doesn't tell us the location of the objects. This is why semantic segmentation goes into the category of [structured prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_prediction) problems. It answers on both the 'what' and 'where' questions while classifcation tells us only 'what'. By classifying each pixel we are infering the structure of the whole scene. Typical examples of input image and target labels for this problem are shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/dataset-overview/) contains a diverse set of stereo video sequences recorded in street scenes from 50 different cities, with high quality pixel-level annotations. Dataset contains 2975 training and 500 validation images of size 2048x1024. The test set of 1000 images is evaluated on the server and benchmark is available [here](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/benchmarks/#scene-labeling-task). Here we will use downsampled images of size 384x160. The original dataset has 19 classes but we lowered that to 7 by uniting similar classes into broader categories. This makes sense due to low visibility of very small objects in downsampled images. We also have ignore class which we need to ignore during training because those pixels don't belong to any class.\n",
